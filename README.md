# OrganizZen

For event planners, team leaders, and collaborative groups who are overwhelmed with a great number of tasks and responsibilities, OrganizZen emerges as an essential event and project management tool. Instead of just offering a simple to-do list, OrganizZen weaves together comprehensive event management capabilities such as a calendar where individuals can schedule meetings and deadlines, as well as robust collaboration by incorporating a chat feature.
